    <p>Join us for the Monster Dash 5K on October 25th at 4:30 PM to support the Oakley Jr/Sr High Cross Country team! This fun, family-friendly event invites participants of all ages to dress up in their favorite costumes and enjoy a festive fall run. Stick around after the main race for a special kids race, perfect for younger runners eager to join the excitement. All proceeds go directly to benefit the cross country team, helping fund travel, equipment, and training opportunities. Come run (or walk), support a great cause, and celebrate the season in spooky style!
